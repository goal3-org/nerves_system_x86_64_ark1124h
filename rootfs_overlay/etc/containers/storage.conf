# Runtime state (short-lived, tmpfs — lost on reboot, which is fine)
runroot = "/run/containers/storage"

# NOTE: additionalimagestore on squashfs is a future optimization.
# Currently we use "podman load" from /srv/containers/postgres.tar at first
# boot, which copies image layers to the writable graphroot once.
# The overlay storage created by "podman load --root" contains root-owned
# container filesystem layers that can't be copied by non-root builds.
# Revisit once Buildroot fakeroot integration is confirmed.
